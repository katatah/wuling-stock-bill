// Solver cost weights — edit this file to tune LP behaviour.
//
// surplus  — penalty per unit/min of unpriced items with no downstream consumer
//            (e.g. copper_nugget when only sewage is needed from copper smelting).
//            Raise if the solver wastes raw materials generating unwanted byproducts.
//
// machine  — base penalty per facility (x_ri) in the objective.
//            Discourages running unnecessary intermediate steps when profit is equal.
//            Keep small so it never overrides real profit differences.
//
// power    — additional penalty per kW of facility power draw, per facility.
//            Total per-facility penalty = machine + power * facility.power_kw.
//            Set to 0 to disable (power-blind, original behaviour).
//            Example: 0.00005 adds 0.001 for a 20 kW Fitting Unit — same order
//            as the base machine penalty, so high-power facilities are gently
//            preferred against when profit is otherwise equal.
